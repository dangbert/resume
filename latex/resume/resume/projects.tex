      \item {Implemented a feed forward neural network from scratch in Python using NumPy.  Studied the linear algebra and calculus needed to implement backpropgation through \href{http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/}{an online course} and validated the performance on the MNIST dataset.}
      \item {Implemented the Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing optimization algorithms in Python 
to optimize employee shift schedules with respect to a heuristic function.}
      \item {Implemented a decision tree, the kmeans classification algorithm, as well as tf-idf for practicing NLP.}

      \item {Designed and implemented (as a solo side project) a website for helping people learn about other countries and cultures.  Allowing users to see the songs trending in each country, as well as twitter trends, and the best YouTube videos for learning about the country (e.g. history/travel/culture).  The website is implemented with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL and is hosted on Google Cloud with automated scripts for pulling data about each country from YouTube, Spotify, and Twitter.}
