      \item {Implemented a feed forward neural network from scratch in Python using NumPy and evaluated the performance on the MNIST dataset after studying the linear algebra and calculus needed to implement backpropgation through \href{http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/}{an online course}.}
      \item {Implemented the Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing optimization algorithms in Python 
to optimize employee shift schedules with respect to a heuristic function.}
      \item {Implemented a decision tree, the kmeans classification algorithm, as well as tf-idf for practicing NLP.}
